> Q: How do the countries compare in terms of how much they receive and donate? Are there countries that donate much more than they receive or receive much more than they donate?

> Q: Do the countries that mostly receive or mostly donate tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world? Are there neighboring countries that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive vs. how much they donate?

> Q: Are there any major differences in how the top 5 most frequent purposes of disbursements (across all countries) distribute geographically in terms of  countries that receive donations? Are there countries that tend to receive more of certain types of donations than others? (Note: it would be more interesting to look at the top 5 purposes locally, for each individual country but visualizing the results may be even harder. If you want to try out a solution for this harder case it would be nice to see it).

> Q: a) How does the amount donated vs. amount received change over time for each country?; b) Are there countries that mostly send or mostly receive and countries that have a similar amount of donations they receive and send?; c) Are there countries that change their role over time? That is, they used to mostly send donations and turn into mostly receiving donations and vice-versa?; d) Are there countries in which you can find a sudden increase ("peak") or a sudden decrease ("valley")?

> Q: Focus on the top 10 “Coalesced Purposes” of donations (in terms of amount of disbursement across all countries and all time). What are the top 10 purposes of disbursements (in terms of total amount of disbursement) and how does their relative amount compare over time? E.g., are there purposes that tend to be prominent for a period of time and others that become more prominent during other periods? Hint: looking at the graph one should be able to observe: “Ah! During these years donations were mostly about X but then there were way more donations about Y”. Note: if the purpose is “UNSPECIFIED” it should be removed.

> Q: Create an overview of the relationships between countries so that it is possible to see who donates to whom and how much. The main question one should be able to answer is: who are the major donors and to which countries do they donate the most and how much? And conversely, who are the major receivers and which countries do they receive from the most and how much? We only care about the top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors (over the whole time) for this question.

> Q: Considering only the top 5 purposes of donation, how does the relationship between countries look like in terms of purposes? What composition (distribution) of  purposes do the donations between each pair of countries have? Are there countries that donate to a given country using multiple purposes? Or do counties always donate using one single purpose when donating to another country? The same as the previous question, we only care about the top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors here.

> Q: For this last exercise you have to extend the analysis above to see how the patterns of donations change over time. Focusing again on the top 10 recipients and top 20 donors how do the patterns of donations (who donates to whom and how much) change over time? Are there sudden changes? Are there countries that always donate to other countries? Are there major shifts (say a country used to donate to a specific set of countries and then it changes to other countries)?
